    <p>This assessment has a few core objectives:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <ObjectiveTitle>Edit Existing Customers:</ObjectiveTitle>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Implement the functionality to update details for an existing
            Customer.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ObjectiveTitle>
          Create a new <code>Product</code> model with the following columns:
        </ObjectiveTitle>
        <ul>
          <li>id</li>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>unit of measure (lb, gal, kg, etc)</li>
          <li>customer (each Product should belong to a Customer)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ObjectiveTitle>Create Products for a Customer:</ObjectiveTitle>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Enable the creation of Product records associated with a specific

          </li>
          <li>

            records are listed.
          </li>

            Ensure the data is clearly presented and easy to interact with.

      no limits to how you solve problems or what you change.
